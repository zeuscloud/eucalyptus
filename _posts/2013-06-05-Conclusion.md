###Conclusion 
We have documented all the parts of our work on a Eucalyptus cloud implementation that we were able to implement successfully.
However, one of the major issues we faced when trying to install Eucalyptus was the lack of 
proper documentation. As a result we were never fully able to understand how to integrate
the Eucalyptus cloud network with the existing network arcitecture of our labs. In contrast,
due to the extensive amount of documentation that OpenStack offers, we believe that OpenStack 
would be a much better choice for understanding and deploying a cloud infrastructure. For this
reason, we have decided to abandon our project at this stage.
